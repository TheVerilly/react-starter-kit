# react-starter-kit
Very simple starter kit for my react web dev projects with **typescript, styled-components, react-hook-form,
react-router and effector (with immer)**

## Ecosystem

* Using font [Eudoxus Sans](https://stijndv.com/goodies/eudoxus-sans/) connected globally from index.html
* For create new alias, just need to edit **tsconfig.json -> paths** and vite-tsconfig-paths plugin will do the rest

Predefined alias:
`Assets`, `Components`, `Pages`, `Data`, `Routes`, `Types`, `Utils`  
**example path: src/components**

## Installing / Developing

Now you are ready to go:

```shell
npm ci
```

**Use to get deterministic, repeatable build**

This will install the dependencies required to run the boilerplate.

```shell
npm run dev
```

Boom! These scripts run your app in development mode.

## Building

To build the project, run:

```shell
npm run build
```
